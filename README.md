# Overview

## Challenge
"This week's Challenge requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes."

## User Story

```md
AS an employee with access to sensitive data,
I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```md
It's done when I click the button to generate a password, and I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
It's done when I select which criteria to include in the password.
It's done when I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
It's done when I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
It's done when I answer each prompt, and my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
It's done when all prompts are answered, and a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.  
It's done when the password is generated, and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
```
